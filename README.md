# InvoiceTool

This is just a simple invoice tool. The idea is that I can expirement with just a few new things that I dont use often. 

The first version of this application will exists of just:
- Clean Architecture
- Entity framework core
- Unit tests

With the second version I will add:
- CQRS 
- MediatR

For the third version I'll create the frontend with Angular. The idea is that I'll use the IONIC framework. IONIC is a framework that allows you to create web and mobile applications with Angular.
Read about IONIC here: [IONIC website](https://ionicframework.com/)


## Some features I might add
- Soft delete for invoices and customers
- StyleCop for code style
- NetArchTest for architecture tests
