# InvoiceTool

This is just a simple invoice tool. The idea is that I can expirement with just a few new things that I dont use often. 

The first version of this application will exists of just:
- Clean Architecture
- Entity framework core
- Unit tests

With the second version I will add:
- CQRS 
- Maybe look for a replacement for AutoMapper (since it's going commercial)

For the third version I'll create the frontend with Angular. The idea is that I'll use the IONIC framework. IONIC is a framework that allows you to create web and mobile applications with Angular.
Read about IONIC here: [IONIC website](https://ionicframework.com/)


## Some features I might add
- Soft delete for invoices and customers
- StyleCop for code style
- NetArchTest for architecture tests 


## Overkill?
- Yes, I do know that this is overkill for a simple invoice tool. But the idea is to expirement with these technologies and patterns


## Custom DocumentTools
- I have used a custom DocumentTools package, just a small package that allows me to create PDF files based of an HTML template. This package is stored in my private github account and not (yet) available to the public. Sorry :(
